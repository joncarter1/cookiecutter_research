Environment set-up
--------
The Python environment for this project is managed using **uv**. Commands can be run with e.g.
```bash
uv run --env-file .env scripts/example.py
```
This will dynamically install necessary dependencies into a local virtual environment (`.venv`) for the project and run the provided script using that environment.
More information on **uv** can be found [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Development

### Automatic code checks

Before commiting changes to Git, run:
```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```
to configure a range of checks (configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) that will run automatically whenever you run `git commit`!

Linting and formatting in this repository are handled by **ruff**. If you find the default linting and formatting rules of **ruff** too strict, it is simple to disable specific rules. See the `[tool.ruff.lint]` section of the `pyproject.toml` configuration file for an example of how to do this.

### Testing
Tests for this project should be stored under the `tests` folder and can be run with `uv run pytest`.

### Docker
Commands can also be run using **Docker**, e.g.:
```bash
docker build . -t {{ project_slug }}:latest
docker run {{ project_slug }}:latest pytest
docker run {{ project_slug }}:latest scripts/example.py
```
